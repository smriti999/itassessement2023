             can paste in the embed code for the video you want to add. You can also type a keyword to

        <p font size="30" bg color="light green">To make your document look professionally produced, Word provides header, footer, cover page,
             and text box designs that complement each other. For example, you can add a matching cover page,
              header, and sidebar. Click Insert and then choose the elements you want from the different galler

            choose a new Theme, the pictures, charts, and SmartArt graphics change to match your new theme. When
             you apply styles, your headings change to match the new theme.

            Save time in Word with new buttons that show up where you need them. To change the way a picture fits 
            in your document, click it and a button for layout options appears next to it. When you work on a table,
             click where you want to add a row or a column, and then click the plus sign.

        <p font size="20" bg color="red">Reading is easier, too, in the new Reading view. You can collapse parts of the document 
            and focus on the text you want. If you need to stop reading before you reach the end, Word remembers 
            where you left off - even on another device.</p>
