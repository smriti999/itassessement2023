        <h1><b><i>Beware of password hackers and crackers!</i></b></h1>
        <hr color="cyan">
        <p>
            The threat of hackers and crackers is for real, and is alike for everything for everyone. If<br>
the security breach at the Babha Atomic Research Center last year by the hacker group<br>
milworm didn't convince you of their capabilities, then consider this: James Davis aka<br>
jdavis_a, a resident of <a href="www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483">www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483</a> homestead community<br>
on the Internet, might just be reading your e-mail in your mailbox right now, or using<br>
your account for some benign Internet surfing, or exchanging it with someone else on the<br>
Net for more such accounts!<br>
Surprised? Or scared?

            Whatever it is, jdevis_4 claims in his home page Free VSNL passwords that he has got<br>
exactly 108 working passwords (and growing daily),<i>36 satyam, 31 MNTL, 11 WimiNet<br>
    and 23 online passwords.</i>
